DELETE THIS BEFORE POSTING ANY GITHUB LINK LOL

I think I want my home page to be a bar on the side or the top.
and then an about section explaining what i have going on. I'm
not sure what would look better.

Biggest issue is deciding a side or a top bar since that will
carry through the rest of the site.

Would like to have my own page where I can make silly buttons.
Could link it in the project page or from the home page. Josh says to use

To-Do List (April 5th):
1. Get the divs to be evenly aligned. The logo box is much larger. They are in a div currently.
Should see about making them 33% apiece. After can center the text in the nav section.
2. Put the border on the bottom of the div. Problem with floating? Can I switch from a float for the child divs?
