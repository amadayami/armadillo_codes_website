DELETE THIS BEFORE POSTING ANY GITHUB LINK LOL

I think I want my home page to be a bar on the side or the top.
and then an about section explaining what i have going on. I'm
not sure what would look better.

Biggest issue is deciding a side or a top bar since that will
carry through the rest of the site.

Would like to have my own page where I can make silly buttons.
Could link it in the project page or from the home page.
